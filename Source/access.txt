1. What is MS Access?
=> MS Access is a Relational DataBase Management System (RDMS) Software.

2. What is table ms access?
=> Table is an object that is used to define and store data.Tables contain fields or columns that store different kinds of data, such as a name or an address, and records.

3. What is record in ms access?
=> A record in Microsoft Access refers to a group of fields, such as a telephone number, address and name, which are pertinent to a particular item. Each record within a 
table holds information about a single entity.

4. How many types of Keys?
=> There are mainly Eight different types of Keys in DBMS and each key has it’s different functionality:

Super Key
Primary Key
Candidate Key
Alternate Key
Foreign Key
Compound Key
Composite Key
Surrogate Key

Let’s look at each of the keys in DBMS with example:

Super Key -  A super key is a group of single or multiple keys which identifies rows in a table.
Primary Key -  It is a column or group of columns in a table that uniquely identify every row in that table.
Candidate Key - It is a set of attributes that uniquely identify tuples in a table. Candidate Key is a super key with no repeated attributes.
Alternate Key - It is a column or group of columns in a table that uniquely identify every row in that table.
Foreign Key - It is a column that creates a relationship between two tables. The purpose of Foreign keys is to maintain data integrity and allow navigation between two 
different instances of an entity.
Compound Key - It has two or more attributes that allow you to uniquely recognize a specific record. It is possible that each column may not be unique by itself within the 
database.
Composite Key - It is a combination of two or more columns that uniquely identify rows in a table. The combination of columns guarantees uniqueness, though individual 
uniqueness is not guaranteed.
Surrogate Key -  An artificial key which aims to uniquely identify each record is called a surrogate key. These kind of key are unique because they are created when you don't 
have any natural primary key.

5. What is Primary Key and Foreign key?

=> PRIMARY KEY in DBMS is a column or group of columns in a table that uniquely identify every row in that table. The Primary Key can't be a duplicate meaning the same value can't appear more than once in the table. A table cannot have more than one primary key.

FOREIGN KEY is a column that creates a relationship between two tables. The purpose of Foreign keys is to maintain data integrity and allow navigation between two different instances of an entity. It acts as a cross-reference between two tables as it references the primary key of another table.
